I was asleep in class again.
My maker hates me and included intentional bugs.
I'm just a bot; I only know what you program me to know.
Hey, shit happens. Get over it.
Some things just can't be explained.
Let's not dwell on the past.
Internal error. It's always an internal error.
I dun fucked up.
I don't owe you an explanation.
Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation. I just don't happen to have it.
Sorry, napping. Try again later.
_Zac has left the building_
Sorry, napping. Try again later.
_C'est la vie._
Because America isn't great again.
The co-ops did it.
It wasn't me...
Aliens made me do it.
It's all Nick's fault.
It's all Jordan's fault.
It's all Kiera's fault.
It's all Jill's fault.
It's all Angel's fault.
It's all Mateo's fault.
It's all Brent's fault.
It's all Chelsea's fault.
It's all Carly's fault.
It's all Slackbot's fault.
It's all my fault.
_I_ did it. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you *meddling kids!*
Society is to blame!
I blame the SYSTEM!!
I'm just a bot; I only know what you program me to know.
It was _YOU!_
I dun fucked up.
Wasn't me. I'm perfect.
I'd blame my parents, except I haven't got 'em.
I blame Kiera.
I blame Jill.
I blame Angel.
I blame Brent.
I blame Nick.
I blame Nick's uggs.
I blame Jordan.
I blame Chelsea.
I blame Carly.
I blame panda bears.
I blame America.
I blame everyone.
I blame the devs.
I blame Team Meeseeks.
I blame Git.
I blame Trump.
I blame crooked Hillary.
Don't look at me!
It's always my fault.
