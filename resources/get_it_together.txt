Get your shit together.
Get your shit together, get it all together
Get your shit together, and put it in a back pack
Get your shit together. --All your shit, so it's together.
Get your shit together, get it all together and put it in a back pack, all your shit, so it's together.
Get your shit together; take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in the shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together.
Get your shit together; I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together.
Get. Your shit. Together.
