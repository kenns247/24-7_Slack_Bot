DO IT
JUST _DO IT_
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Yesterday you said tomorrow, so _JUST DO IT_
MAKE. YOUR DREAMS. COME TRUE.
Just *DO IT*
Some people dream of success, while you're gonna wake up and _work hard at it_
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
You should get to the point, where anyone else would quit and you're nOT GOING TO STOP THERE
No, what are you waiting for? _DO IT_
_Yes you can!!_
If you're tired of starting over, _STOP GIVING UP_
