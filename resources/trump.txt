Wrong.
You’re disgusting.
Make America Great Again.
I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.

You're fired.
I know words, I have the best words.
