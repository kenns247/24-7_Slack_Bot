HOW CAN YOU SEE INTO MY EYES LIKE OPEN DOORS?
LEADING YOU DOWN INTO MY CORE WHERE I'VE BECOME SO NUMB
WITHOUT A SOUL MY SPIRIT'S SLEEPING SOMEWHERE COLD
*WAKE ME UP*
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
*CAN'T WAKE UP*
*WAKE ME UP INSIDE*
*SAVE MEEEEEEEEE*
CALL MY NAME AND SAVE ME FROM THE DARK
BID MY BLOOD TO RUN BEFORE I COME UNDONE
SAVE ME FROM THE NOTHING I'VE BECOME
NOW THAT I KNOW WHAT I'M WITHOUT, YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME
BREATHE INTO ME AND MAKE ME REAL
BRING ME TO LIFE
*BRIIIIIIING MEEEEE TOOOOOO LIIIIIIIIIFE*
*WAKE ME UP*
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
*CAN'T WAKE UP*
*WAKE ME UP INSIDE*
*SAVE MEEEEEEEEE*
*I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE* 
*THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE*
FROZEN INSIDE WITHOUT YOUR TOUCH, WITHOUT YOUR LOVE, DARLING
ONLY YOU ARE THE LIFE AMONG THE DEAD
*ALL THIS TIME I CAN'T BELIEVE I COULDN'T SEE*
*KEPT IN THE DARK BUT YOU WERE THERE IN FRONT OF ME*
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING A THOUSAND YEARS IT SEEMS
GOT TO OPEN MY EYES TO EVERYTHING
*BRIIIIIIING MEEEEE TOOOOOO LIIIIIIIIIFE*
*WAKE ME UP*
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
*CAN'T WAKE UP*
*WAKE ME UP INSIDE*
*SAVE MEEEEEEEEE*
CALL MY NAME AND SAVE ME FROM THE DARK
BID MY BLOOD TO RUN BEFORE I COME UNDONE
SAVE ME FROM THE NOTHING I'VE BECOME
WITHOUT A THOUGHT, WITHOUT A VOICE, WITHOUT A SOUL
*DON'T LET ME DIE HERE*
*THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE*
