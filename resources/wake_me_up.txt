How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
*WAKE ME UP*
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
*CAN'T WAKE UP*
SAVE ME
*SAVE MEEEEEEEEE*
CALL MY NAME AND SAVE ME FROM THE DARK
BID MY BLOOD TO RUN
BEFORE I COME UNDONE
SAVE ME FROM THE NOTHING I'VE BECOME
Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life
BRING ME TO LIVE
I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE 
THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead
ALL THIS TIME I CAN'T BELIEVE I COULDN'T SEE
KEPT IN THE DARK BUT YOU WERE THERE IN FRONT OF ME
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
DON'T LET ME DIE HERE
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE
